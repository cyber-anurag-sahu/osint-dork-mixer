🕵️‍♂️ OSINT DORK MIXER V2

Advanced Reconnaissance Matrix Relative Intelligence / V.2.0.4

OSINT Dork Mixer is a browser-based Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tool designed to automate the generation of complex Google Dorks. By inputting known variables about a target (Name, Username, Company, Location, etc.), the tool "mixes" these data points to create targeted search queries for uncovering social media profiles, public documents, government records, and hidden digital footprints.

    Note: This tool functions entirely client-side. No data is stored, transmitted, or logged.

⚡ Features

    Advanced Mixing Logic: Intelligently combines input fields to create specific queries (e.g., Name + Company + Filetype:PDF or Username + Site:Github).

    Multi-Category Generation:

        🔥 Priority Combinations: High-probability hits for professional documents and associations.

        🌐 Social Intelligence: Targeted lookups across LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, etc.

        🏛️ Gov / Public Records: Scans for government affiliation and public disclosure documents.

        📄 Document Discovery: Specifically hunts for Resumes, CVs, and Directories.

    Cyberpunk UI: Built with a "Glassmorphism" aesthetic using JetBrains Mono and Orbitron fonts for a focused, terminal-like experience.

    One-Click Action:

        🔍 Search: Instantly opens the dork in a new Google tab.

        📋 Copy: Copies individual dorks or entire categories to the clipboard.

        💾 Export: Download/Copy the full dataset for reporting.
